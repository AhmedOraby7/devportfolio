              Graduate Data Scientist with 2 years of experience as a Data
              Engineer as well as a Software Engineer at companies like Amazon,
              Ejada, and exporto. I also have a massive passion for data and
              building end-to-end data science projects. I hold my computer
              science bachelor's in 2018 and then worked as a Data Engineer for
              18 months. In 2020, I decided to start my master's here in
              Germany, That was not the best time to start a new degree (Due to
              Corona) but I have finally made it, I'm graduating this June.
              During my master's, I got the chance to work at Amazon Berlin. I
              did a lot of software projects that are currently being used by
              millions of customers.

              playing video games like Fifa. I also play chess (Not good tho :D)
              and read books about data science.

          <h3>Exporto</h3>
          <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
          <p>
            Exporto is a startup company offering a boardless delivery
            experience for its customers. I worked for Exporto as a working
            student (20 hours/week). My main focus was to improve the runtime
            for some SQL queries as well as improve some of the features in the
            UI. I worked there for almost 6 months and during that period, I had
            the chance to develop/ompitze the following:
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>
            Improved search experience for Exporto’s customers by optimizing SQL
            queries (x2 speed) as well as enhancing the UX.
          </li>
          <li>
            mplemented a global category search from scratch to help Exporto’s
            warehouse worker to process all the parcels efficiently..

          <h3>Amazon</h3>
          <h4>Software Engineer Intern</h4>
          <p>
            Working for Amazon was one of the best experiences I've had so far.
            I had the chance to work with a lot of talented people. I worked on
            two different projects. I led both my projects end-to-end which
            means I didn't just develop the back/front end but also wrote unit
            tests and integration tests and finally delivered my projects to
            production. These are the most projects I'm proud of, Why? Because
            these projects have a significant impact on AWS customers as well as
            AWS leadership and they are being used by thousands of people. I
            also helped the team to test their AWS Synthetics locally by running
            them on Chromium instaed of pushing the code to gamma.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>
            Implemented advanced filters for AWS QuickSetup services from
            scratch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved UX experience for QuickSetup so that, every new fresh
            customer knows what the service offers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a new workflow for AWS Synthetics so that the team can
            run it locally (Previously the team had to deploy to gamma first to
            test their AWS Synthetic).
